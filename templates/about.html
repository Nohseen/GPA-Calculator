            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                The SGPA Calculator is a web application built using <strong>Flask</strong>.
                It has been developed with the objective of helping students calculate their
                <strong>Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)</strong> quickly and accurately.
                By entering the obtained grades, students can instantly compute their SGPA
                without the need for manual calculations.
            </p>

            <h2>Why RTU Kota?</h2>
            <p>
                This project is specifically designed for students of <strong>Rajasthan Technical University (RTU),
                    Kota</strong>.
                Since the initial result declaration provided by RTU only displays the <em>grades</em> for each subject,
                students are left without an official SGPA value for that semester.
                This calculator bridges that gap by allowing students to enter their grades
                and get the precise SGPA based on their semester's credit structure.
            </p>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The primary purpose of this project is to make academic tracking easier for RTU students.
                By providing a simple and user-friendly platform, students can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Calculate their SGPA instantly after results are declared.</li>
                <li>Track performance across semesters.</li>
                <li>Plan academic improvements by knowing their exact score.</li>
            </ul>
